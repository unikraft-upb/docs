### Deploying Cloud Applications using KraftCloud

If you did not create an account already, signup [here](https://console.kraft.cloud/signup) and get a `token`.
You will be using that in the following sessions.

Once you have a token, follow the steps [here](http://docs.kraft.cloud/quickstart/) to deploy your first unikernel.
If everything went well, deploy more applications following the tasks [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1exnUCaUvDx_FldLOz9HNnGpbmaafMYVL_0Tu6A6AFL4/edit#gid=0).

### Behind the Scenes: Using KraftKit to Operate Unikraft Applications

In the previous session, you deployed application using KraftCloud.
Now you will build and run Unikraft-based application locally.
With this, you will get a better look at what `kraft cloud` does behind the scenes.

Follow the steps [here](https://unikraft.org/guides/using-the-app-catalog) and bring the cloud to your machine.
After you are done with all of them, take a look to some more applications, following the tasks [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1exnUCaUvDx_FldLOz9HNnGpbmaafMYVL_0Tu6A6AFL4/edit#gid=89673838).
Go through them orderly and aim to complete all items until the `Extra` section.
If you have extra time on your hands, go through the `Extra` section as well.

### Using Docker and Docker-based Filesystems

In order to bring your own application on KraftCloud, you need to build a minimal required filesystem.
We do that using `docker`.
This is useful both to understand what is happening behind the scenes and to have a test environment for your application.
In case there are issues with KraftCloud / KraftKit, you can use Docker to see if everything is in the right place and to assist in debugging.

Follow the steps [here](https://unikraft.org/docs/contributing/adding-to-the-app-catalog) (only the ones under `Redis`) to see how you can port a new application on top of Unikraft.
Mark the items as completed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1exnUCaUvDx_FldLOz9HNnGpbmaafMYVL_0Tu6A6AFL4/edit#gid=1549350059).
Go through them orderly and aim to complete all items until the `Extra` section.
If you have extra time on your hands, go through the `Extra` section as well.

### Debugging Unikraft / KraftCloud Applications

When porting new applications, you can run into issues both on the Docker build and on the Unikraft runtime.
To debug the issues, you can follow the instructions [here](https://docs.kraft.cloud/guides/features/debugging/).
Get a hands-on experience with debugging by following the items [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1exnUCaUvDx_FldLOz9HNnGpbmaafMYVL_0Tu6A6AFL4/edit#gid=680791461).

### Hackathon

For the hackathon, please create teams of 2-3 people, and create your very own cloud-native application to run on KraftCloud.
Think of a cool application you've been waiting for a while to implement.
Use your preferred programming language (supported by KraftCloud), employ any frameworks or existing software components as required, and then deploy it on KraftCloud.
After you create a team and decide on a project, fill [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cnkDy3o3ddqoySfmnH1Ft78w532f3aAGQ2cgSgx4uPc/edit?usp=sharing) with the team name, members and project idea.

At the and of the hackathon, you should make a PR in the [KraftCloud `examples` repository](https://github.com/kraftcloud/examples) with your work.
We will be evaluating the project, focusing on functionality, originality, robustness, complexity, code quality and team work.
