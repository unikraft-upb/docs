## Challenges

You've made it so far.
Now the time has come to show the Unikraft world what you are really made of.
A true Dragon Slayer!

See the items marked with `kind/hackathon` and added in the [`Hackathons` project](https://github.com/orgs/unikraft/projects/29).

You will get the number of points for submitting a solution that works.
Those points will be doubled if the PR is accepted upstream.
After solving one challenge, pick another one.
We recommend you start small then move up to more difficult challenges.

We will keep the scoreboard [here](https://leaderboardhq.com/3wt61mcc).

Please check the community guidelines on [submitting changes](https://github.com/unikraft/docs/blob/main/content/en/docs/contributing/submitting-changes.md) and [the review process](https://github.com/unikraft/docs/blob/main/content/en/docs/contributing/review-process.md).
