## Challenges

TODO: Link to challenges

You will get the number of points for submitting a solution that works.
Those points will be doubled if the PR is accepted upstream.
After solving one challenge, pick another one.
We recommend you start small then move up to more difficult challenges.

We'll keep the scores [here](TODO).

Please check the community guidelines on [submitting changes](https://github.com/unikraft/docs/blob/main/content/en/docs/contributing/submitting-changes.md) and [the review process](https://github.com/unikraft/docs/blob/main/content/en/docs/contributing/review-process.md).
