title: Binary Compatibility
description: |
  The binary-compatibility layer (bincompat) is used to run unmodified Linux binaries (ELFs) on top of Unikraft.
---

One challenge with Unikraft is the potential porting effort required for new applications.
To address this, Unikraft includes a **binary-compatibility layer** which allows the running of Linux binaries (ELFs) on top of Unikraft.

For such a layer to work, Unikraft has the explicit goal to comply, as much as possible, with Linux's ABI (_Application Binary Interface_), providing a large range of its system call interface.
Concretely, in Unikraft this is handled through its [**system call shim layer**](/docs/internals/syscall-shim) (also called **syscall shim**), which provides Linux-style mappings of system call numbers to actual system call handler functions.

<Info>
Currently, binary-compatibility is available on x86_64, with work ongoing to make this available for AArch64.
Also note that KVM is currently the only supported hypervisor, with QEMU and Firecracker as VMMs (_Virtual Machine Monitors_).

<Info>
Currently, binaries have to be built as PIE (*Position-Independent Executables*).
This is the default build mode for the majority of Linux distributions, so it shouldn't cause any problems.

<Info>
Note that, because Linux binaries are included, constructing new Linux binaries requires a Linux or Linux-compatible development environement (such as WSL - _Windows Subsystem for Linux_).
This is only the case for building binaries -- prebuilt binaries can be used and the ELF loader app itself can be built on multiple platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS).

Binary-compatible apps are located in the Unikraft [application `catalog` repository](https://github.com/unikraft/catalog).
